version control Lesson 1 reflections:

1. version control helps to find the changes made in the files while version change. this helps to find the bug created

2. In Mac, there is an inbuilt tool to track the change in different versions. diff -u {old file} {new file with extensions}

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

the typo was identified very easily

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

the changes that are made in the file can be monitored, and any unintentional change can be tracked

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

-> pro: no unnecessary verisons. easy for debugging
	con: dependency on the user. might make to large commits that may make is difficult the debugging process

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-> git is specifically designed for coding purpose. in coding, usaually more than 1 file are interconnected. thus, multiple file saving in one commit comes handy
